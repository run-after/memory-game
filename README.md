MEMORY CARD GAME

This is a project from The Odin Project(https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/javascript/lessons/memory-card)

Created with React using functional components with hooks.

The game is simple, you choose a card, the cards shuffle, then you select another card. You want to only click each card once, otherwise your score goes to 0.

This game will keep track of your score, and display your high score.
